# Pareto-Weighted-Sum-Tuning
The Pareto-Weighted-Sum-Tuning (PWST) utilizes Learning-to-Rank Machine Learning to help solve Pareto (Multiobjective, Multicriteria) Optimization Problems.
This codebase utilizes PWST to run experiments with a sample user/decision-maker on an example stock-pricing dataset.

# Usage
To run the experiment, run the following command.
```bash
python example.py
```
